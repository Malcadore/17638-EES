## Course Description

This course will introduce students to the design and implementation of sensor-based systems within an embedded systems context.  The course's major components are design documentation and C based implementation based on that design.  Throughout the course we will be discussing different design notions and study the workings of sensors, embedded systems, and wireless sensor nodes. 

## Prior Knowledge

Students taking this course should have some prior experience with IoT or embedded devices, but it isn’t a hard prerequisite.  Having hobbyist or classroom experience working with Arduino or Raspberry PI is beneficial but a prerequisite.  The course has significant programming components, requiring writing C code compiled on the gcc compiler.  The class will require proficiency with C/C++ to succeed.  No prior knowledge of sensors or wireless systems is necessary.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this course, you will be able to:
•	Design system pieces using standard graphical notation in documentation as well as documenting code
•	Build (code) parts of sensor based embedded systems from previously designed elements
•	Evaluate the effectiveness of software designs in guiding software implementations

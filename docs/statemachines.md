## Types of State Machines
- HSM - Heirarchichal State Machines
- FSM - Finite State Machine

## Background
- What are state machines
- Linking state machines to the behavior of contolled objects
- Linking state machines to events and time
- Processes, Transitions, and Constraints

## Design Guidance
- Changes in enviornment state
- Needed behavioral changes in the application
    - Example: 

## Elements in a State Machine
- Activities
- State Transitions

## Modeling State Machines
- Modeling techniques for State Machines
- State Diagrams, State Charts
- UML
- SysML

# Toolchain Support

Generally, the course supports the use of tools on Windows and Ubuntu 22.04.  It's highly recommended that you have access to linux for a portion of the course as it is the supported operating system.  Use of Apple and Windows has been done by students in the past, but the responsibility of managing tools ultimately is the job of the engineer.
